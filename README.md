# Graph Neural Network Tutorials
Neural networks created as teaching material for Magnify Mentoring 2023, with a focus on graph neural networks. These notebooks assume the learner has had previous experience with understanding and coding basic neural networks (regardless of whether the learner comes from Keras/PyTorch/Tensorflow), and has little to no experience with graph neural networks.

Written in PyTorch for use with Google Colab. Several notebooks adapted from UvA Deep Learning Fall 2022 (https://uvadlc.github.io/).

## How to run notebooks

To run notebooks, open in Jupyter or in Google Colab. For ease of access, each notebook has a badge under the title that links to a copy of the notebook on Google Colab.
